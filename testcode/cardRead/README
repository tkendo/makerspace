README - cardRead
by: T Kendo
date: 1/30/2017

This folder contains python code that can read the HID based USB magnetic
strip card reader. This is based off the the pyusb-keyboard-alike open
source project from:

https://github.com/riklaunim/pyusb-keyboard-alike

The script test_hid.py uses the Reader class from the keyboard_alike project
and reads in a single card swipe. This must be run with root access to talk
to the card reader. 

Calls to the read() method are blocking.
